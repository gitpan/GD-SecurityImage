GD::SecurityImage
=================

The (so called) "Security Images" are so popular. Most internet 
software use these in their registration screens to block robot programs
(which may register tons of  fake member accounts). This module gives
you a basic interface to create such an image. 

Read the module's POD for documentation and examples.
