Revision history for Perl extension GD::SecurityImage.

Time zone is GMT+2.

1.32 Wed Jul 28 15:49:12 2004
	=> Minimal fix in create().
	=> There is a bug in PerlMagicks older than 6.0.4.
	   From <http://www.imagemagick.org/www/Changelog.html>:
	   "PerlMagick's QueryFontMetrics() incorrectly reports 
	   `unrecognized attribute'` for the `font' attribute".
	   Image::Magick test is now skipped if your 
	   $Image::Magick::VERSION is smaller than 6.0.4.
	   Please upgrade to 6.0.4, if you want to use Image::Magick
	   as the backend.
	=> Added this bug to Pod.

1.31 Sun Jun 27 00:08:49 2004
	=> Updated Pod.
	=> send_ctobg is disabled automatically if style is 
	   set to 'box'.
	=> All styles can put a frame around the image now.
	   And this feature is enabled by default.
	=> New option 'frame' added to new().
	=> Renamed constants in GD::SecurityImage::GD.
	=> Changed tests.

1.3 Mon Jun 21 19:11:13 2004
	=> New method particle().
	=> Private method r2h().
	=> Fixed color conversion for Image::Magick.
	=> out() now accepts arguments.
	=> Updated pod.

1.2 Fri Jun 18 21:39:08 2004
	=> Added raw() method.
	=> Fixed gd_font object key.
	=> new style "ec".
	=> Adapted Image::Magick compatibility (request from Mark Fuller).
	   I may add Image::Magick spesific styles in future releases.
	=> New modules added: 
	      GD::SecurityImage::GD
	      GD::SecurityImage::Magick
	      GD::SecurityImage::Styles
	   and GD::SecurityImage is smaller now ;)
	=> Renamed old tests to (added 'gd_' to names):
	      t/gd_01_use.t
	      t/gd_02_normal.t
	      t/gd_03_ttf.t
	=> Added new tests:
              t/im_01_use.t
              t/im_02_ttf.t
        => Altered Makefile.PL and test files to skip tests if the user selects to do so.

1.1 Fri May 14 22:08:39 2004
	=> Added 'send_ctobg' option to new().
	=> After testing the code with a *really* old GD 
	   (1.19 -- which has no ttf support), I've realized 
	   that stringFT was implemented in GD 1.31. 
	   So, the ttf test now has a skip option.
	=> Also added stringTTF check for backward compatibility.
	   stringTTF => (GD 1.20 @ 30 Aug 1999 )
	   stringFT  => (GD 1.31 @ 26 Sep 2001 )
	=> Fixed pod. There was an '=item' instead of '=head'.
	=> Added new styles 'circle' and 'ellipse'.
	=> Updated 03_ttf.t

1.0 Mon Apr 26 21:40:45 2004
	=> First release.
